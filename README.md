# Moro, as they say here in Central Finland! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Roni a Full Stack developer living in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland. I'm the founder guy behind the scenes at [Dude](https://www.dude.fi) (a digital agency that provides well-made WordPress websites and brand identities) and a popular [air-light WordPress theme](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light) among other open source projects.

I like to tinker with all-things-web, organize local Finnish WordPress Meetups, and in general just work with WordPress based sites. When Iâ€™m not in front of a screen, I like to enjoy [a good book](http://goodreads.com/rolle). You can practically find me anywhere on the internet, my usersname is usually rolle (nickname) or ronilaukkarinen (full name). For gamertags I use [Qllervo](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/Qllervo-2545).
