I'm Roni. I'm active, online and available on GitHub! I'm here to help!<br>
I love open source and its endless possibilities. What can I do for you?

I created my first website when I was about ten years old (around 1998), and I've been in love with everything web-related ever since. I'm a sysop and a full stack developer based in [Jyväskylä, Finland](https://visitjyvaskyla.fi/en). I'm the founder behind [Dude](https://www.dude.fi), a digital agency that builds high-quality WordPress websites, WordPress-optimized servers, and brand identities. I'm also the creator of the popular [Air-light WordPress theme](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light) and several other open source projects.

> **OS**: Arch Linux, macOS<br>
> **Browser:** [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)<br>
> **Editor:** [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)<br>
> **Top programming languages:** Shell scripting, SCSS, PHP<br>
> **Path:** Front end

> Although I consider myself a full stack developer (design → back end → servers → front end → DB), my passion and strongest skills are in servers, CSS, HTML, and accessibility. I know it’s a funny combo.
