# Moro, as they say here in Central Finland! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Roni. I'm a [Full Stack developer](https://twitter.com/rolle/status/1300716606788702208) living in [JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland](https://visitjyvaskyla.fi/en). I'm the founder guy behind the scenes at [Dude](https://www.dude.fi) (a digital agency that provides well-made WordPress websites and brand identities) and a popular [air-light WordPress theme](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light) among other open source projects.

I like to tinker with all-things-web, organize local Finnish WordPress Meetups, and in general just work with WordPress based sites. When Iâ€™m not in front of a screen, I like to enjoy [a good book](http://goodreads.com/rolle). You can practically find me anywhere on the internet, my usersname is usually rolle (nickname) or ronilaukkarinen (full name).

For gamertags I use [Qllervo](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/Qllervo-2545). Background story: A long time ago when I played Quake I chose my real life nickname Rolle as my nick. But as it is widely used name in Sweden and Germany and always taken I decided to add Q in the end as in Quake, so the nick became RolleQ. It happened it was taken too, so I reversed it which became Qllero in spoken Finnish dialect. Also it's a name [Kullervo from ancient Finnish epic literature Kalevala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullervo) with a Q and sounds the same when said in Finnish so and it was not used so it stuck.
