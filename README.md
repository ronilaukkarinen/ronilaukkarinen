# Moro, as they say here in Central Finland! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Roni. I created my first website when I was ten years old and I've been in love with all things web ever since. I'm currently a [Full Stack developer](https://twitter.com/rolle/status/1300716606788702208) living in [JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland](https://visitjyvaskyla.fi/en). I'm the founder guy behind the scenes at [Dude](https://www.dude.fi) (a digital agency that provides well-made WordPress websites and brand identities) and a popular [air-light WordPress theme](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light) among other open source projects.

I like to tinker with all-things-web, organize local Finnish WordPress Meetups, and in general just work with WordPress based sites. From all programming languages **CSS is my strongest suit**.

You can practically find me anywhere on the internet, my username is usually rolle (nickname) or ronilaukkarinen (full name).
